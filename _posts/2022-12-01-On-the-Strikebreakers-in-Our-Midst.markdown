The decision by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, and Jamaal Bowman to support President Bidenâ€™s effort to impose a contract on the railway workers and impose a legal sanction against a strike is a blow against the very heart of the socialist project. Solidarity with labor is the non-negotiable foundation of socialism, and the betrayal of the railway workers is the betrayal of that foundation, and indeed a betrayal of our movement and our organization.

>Solidarity with labor is the non-negotiable foundation of socialism, and the betrayal of the railway workers is the betrayal of that foundation, and indeed a betrayal of our movement and our organization.

The Winter Caucus therefore reaffirms our solidarity with the railway workers as the fight for a contract on their terms and will support their efforts through any strike, legal or illegal. Further, we identify the following steps as those most becoming of a healthy socialist organization:

1) The rescindment of the endorsements of Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, and the expulsion of those Representatives and of Representative Jamaal Bowman.

2) In recognition of the repeated failure of our organization to implement discipline to our platform and to our organization and the structural inadequacy of our organization to do so at this time, the implementation of a moratorium on new congressional endorsements for 2024, and until such time that our organization has reorganized itself on principals of proletarian democracy, programmatic accountability, and active membership and developed our base and apparatus in such a fashion that the organization of a disciplined caucus of socialists in congress can be maintained.

Nonetheless, we further recognize that the structure of DSA as it is currently formed is not capable of undertaking such steps through its leadership bodies, but rather that in order to build DSA as the socialist party we need, we must organize the rank and file membership to take ownership of the organization as an organization by and for the working class.
